    "name": "Jackson Pollock, One: Number 31",
    "prompt": "The painting is a large, cream-colored canvas with ribbons of gray, olive green, teal, black, white, and brown enamel house paint that have been dripped, poured, and splattered onto the surface. The drips vary in length and width and overlap to form intricate webs of paint with a glossy, textured surface. Some of the paint has absorbed into the canvas, while others have built up into broad pools and stains. The painting leaves a visible border of the raw canvas around its perimeter.",
